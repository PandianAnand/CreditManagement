# Credit Limit Recommendation with Machine Learning 

This project explores how machine learning can be used in order to suggest the Credit Limit Recommendation using the dataset from Basic Energy Services. It was developed from Real AI Solutions, helping Basic Energy Services.

## 📊 Project Overview
Using classification models like logistic regression and regression models like linear regression, this project analyzes whether a given Credit Limit is correct for each customer and suggests the recommended Credit Limit.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

The project has one google colab notebook, which represents the entire stage of creating and testing the ML model:

1. **Section 1** – Data exploration, data cleaning, and ML model building.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Machine Learning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Regression

## 📁 Files
- `Customer_Credit_Solution.ipynb`: 📊 Data exploration and Credit Limit recommendation models.

## 🔍 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook in google colab

## 📌 Results
- Achieved **.9974 R^2** using linear regression on the Basic Energy Services dataset.
