# Credit Management Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning to help energy service providers, like Basic Energy Services, assess and manage customer credit risk more accurately. The model predicts optimal credit limits based on historical account data, helping reduce financial losses and ensure fair customer treatment.

## 🧠 Objective
To build a supervised learning model that can:
- Predict an appropriate credit limit for each customer
- Identify patterns in payment behavior and receivables
- Improve decision-making in customer credit assignment

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Linear Regression** for predictive modeling
- **Data preprocessing & feature engineering** for ML readiness

## 📊 Data Features
- Total receivables
- Aging categories (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days)
- Days since last transaction
- Average days late
- Existing credit limit

> Note: Data is simulated to reflect typical customer behavior patterns based on real-world structure.

## 🔍 Model Summary
- Built and trained a linear regression model to predict customer credit limits
- Achieved high accuracy (R² > 0.99 in final iteration)
- Iteratively improved feature scaling and outlier handling to refine model performance

## 💼 Real-World Relevance
This project was developed as part of my consulting work under **RealAI Solutions**, where I deliver applied machine learning tools to businesses. This model helps companies:
- Make smarter credit decisions
- Lower risk of bad debt
- Improve cash flow predictability

## 📁 Structure
- `Customer_Credit_Solution.ipynb`: Complete notebook with data analysis, model training, evaluation, and insights
- `README.md`: Project summary and instructions

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand to classification-based credit risk scoring
- Integrate external credit bureau data (if available)
- Develop a web-based tool for real-time limit suggestions
